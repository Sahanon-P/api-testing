# API testing

## Service Site
The chosen service site API group is [Suchon Site](https://github.com/SuchonSite/Server)

There are 2 APIs in this group which you can see in this documentation [API Documentation](https://github.com/SuchonSite/Server/wiki/API)

Most of the endpoints will be `GET` request so the I can only check the status code and headers contents.

## Government
The chosen Government API group is [World Class Government](https://github.com/WorldClassProgrammers/Government-APIs)

Most of the endpoints are actually work and easy to test. You can see their API documentation [here](https://wcg-apis.herokuapp.com/api-doc/#/)
